# Ansible Bootstrap

A bunch of python/shell scripts and Ansible playbook to bootstrap (update and
configure lightly) a server that only has sshd configured and possibly even no
outbound http traffic allowed.

Done in a few days, at a time when I needed to configure some old
CentOS/Debian/FreeBSD/OpenBSD servers that were severely firewalled and
outdated.
